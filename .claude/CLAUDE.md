# Project Rules

## Session Continuity (MANDATORY)

At the START of every session, read `.claude/handoffs/_active.md` to recover context from prior sessions.
During work, update the handoff proactively after significant milestones.
Use `/handoff` before `/clear`. Use `/resume` to pick up. Use `/switch-context <topic>` to switch workstreams.
